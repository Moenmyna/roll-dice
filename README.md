# Roll dice!

Been trying to learn Python recently and I wanted to try and apply what I'd learned so far into making a small, commandline based dice roller.

When you run the script, it will give you a choice of die to roll; once picked it will roll the die and output the result of the roll. Currently to roll again, you just run the script again.

As I learn more, I may add to this and/or improve it further, we'll see!

## Requirements

Python 3.6+
